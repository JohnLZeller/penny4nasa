# Penny4NASA

Home to the [Penny4NASA](http://penny4nasa.org) site.

We uphold the importance of NASA by highlighting scientific exploration, research and education as paramount to society’s success. NASA’s current budget, at 0.5% of the total U.S. budget, does not reflect the hugely important economic, technological and inspirational resource that this agency has been in its 50+ year history. This is the people saying that as a society, we want our tax dollars to reflect the importance of scientific exploration, research and education; and 0.5% doesn’t cut it. The NASA budget must be increased to at least 1% of the U.S. federal budget.

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/SpaceAdvocates/penny4nasa
cd penny4nasa
```

**2\.** Install all modules and needed tools
